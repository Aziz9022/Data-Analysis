# Project Title: Road Accident Analysis

Description:
The Road Accident Analysis project focuses on understanding the causes, trends, and impact of traffic accidents through comprehensive data analysis. The goal is to identify risk factors, evaluate road safety measures, and recommend preventive strategies to reduce casualties.

Using secondary data collected from online sources, the project examines several key metrics, including total casualties, accident severity, vehicle type, location-based analysis, and monthly trends. The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and visualized using Power BI to derive actionable insights.

The project applies multiple analytical approaches:

Descriptive Analysis: Studied accident characteristics such as time, location, and severity.

Statistical Analysis: Identified patterns, trends, and correlations within accident data.

Spatial Analysis: Leveraged GIS-based mapping to visualize accident hotspots and high-risk zones.

Outcome:
The findings from this project highlight the key factors contributing to road accidents and provide insights useful for policymakers, urban planners, and law enforcement to enhance road safety initiatives and reduce accident-related casualties.

Tools & Technologies: Power BI, Microsoft Excel, GIS (for spatial mapping), Data Cleaning & Visualization techniques.
